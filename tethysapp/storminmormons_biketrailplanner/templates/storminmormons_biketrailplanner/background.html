  <h1>Bike Trail Planner</h1>
<!--Your main page should be about the app and should list your team name-->
<!--and give some instructions about how to use it-->
<h6><i>Developed by Team Stormin Mormons</i></h6>
<hr>
<p>This app was developed at Brigham Young University, as part of a requirement for <i>Geospatial Software Development</i> (CE En 514), taught by professor <a href="https://ceen.et.byu.edu/content/dan-ames" target="_blank">Daniel P. Ames</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this app is two-fold.  1) To provide bicycle trail planners with a feasibility analysis for locating a potential route; and 2) to pass this class.</p>
<p>To operate this app:</p>
          <ol>Click the Starting Point button on the left. Then click a point on the map within Utah County for the starting trailhead for the bike trail.</ol>
          <ol>Click the Ending Point button on the left. Then click a point on the map within Utah County for the ending trailhead for the bike trail.</ol>
          <ol>Toggle desired features (Schools, Local Parks, and FrontRunner Stations). If features are toggled on, the route will be adjusted to follow these features. </ol>
          <p>After these inputs have been received, click the "Calculate Path" button. The route, the total distance, estimated time of travel, and an elevation profile plot of the route will be generated.</p>
          <p>If your are unsatisfied with the results, or if you want to change certain inputs, click the "Refresh" button and repeat the previous steps.</p>
